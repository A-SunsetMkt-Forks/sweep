def new_feature_function():
    # Implement the logic for the new feature here
    new_feature = "Result of the new feature"
    # Here we can add the actual business logic for the new feature.
    # For example, if the new feature is to calculate the sum of two numbers, we can do:
    num1 = 5
    num2 = 10
    new_feature = num1 + num2

    # Return the result
    return new_feature
