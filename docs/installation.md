# Welcome to Sweep - Your AI Junior Developer! 🎉

We're excited to have you on board! To get started, here's a quick guide to help you make the most out of Sweep:

Prerequisites: 
- [Install Sweep](https://github.com/apps/sweep-ai)

## Step 1: Create an Issue 🐞

Create a new issue in your repository. The issue title should start with "Sweep: ", like "Sweep: In sweepai/app/ui.py, use an os-agnostic temp directory" for Sweep to create a PR to solve it.

## Step 2: Responding to Sweep 💬

If you don't like something about the PR, comment on the PR with "Sweep: ", e.g. "Sweep: use PyTorch instead of Tensorflow". You can also comment in the issue and code. For more details on this see [Commenting](https://docs.sweep/commenting).

## Step 3: Star Sweep Repository ⭐

Make sure to star our [open-source GitHub repo](https://github.com/sweepai/sweep) for better results! Also join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/sweep-ai) to stay updated with all the latest features and improvements. We're constantly enhancing Sweep based on your feedback.
