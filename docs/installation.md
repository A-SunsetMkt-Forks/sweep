## Limitations of Sweep ⚠️

* 🏗️ **Large-scale refactors**: >3 files or >150 lines of code changes (we're working on this!)
    * e.g. Refactor entire codebase from Tensorflow to PyTorch

* ⏲️ **Using the latest APIs** that have changed past 2022
    * e.g. Set up a vector store using LlamaIndex Typescript    
    * 🎩 If you provide the relevant docs however, then Sweep can do this

* 🖼️ **Editing images** and other non-text assets
    * e.g. Use the logo to create favicons for our landing page

* ⤵️ **Accessing external APIs**, including fetching API tokens
    * e.g. Set up sign-in using Ethereum
