# ðŸ’¬ Responding to Sweep

You can respond to Sweep in three places:
1. **Issue**: Sweep will create a new pull request and close the old one
2. **Pull request**: Sweep will update the PR based on your PR comments
3. **Code**: Sweep will only update the file that the comment is on

Whenever you make a message that Sweep is taking a look at, you will see an ðŸ‘€ emoji.

Further, on failed Github Action runs, Sweep will update the PR based on the error message.
