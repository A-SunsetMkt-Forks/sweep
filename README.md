## Quickstart Guide

Getting started with Sweep is easy. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Install Sweep by following the instructions in the 'Installation' section.
2. Once Sweep is installed, you can start using it to solve problems. For example, let's say the payment link on your website is not working. You can use Sweep to fix this issue.
3. To do this, you would create a ticket with Sweep describing the problem: "The payment link in my website does not work."
4. Sweep will then generate a plan to fix the issue and modify the necessary files, in this case, 'payments.ts'.
5. Once the changes are made, Sweep will create a pull request with the fixes.
6. Review the pull request and if everything looks good, merge it to deploy the fixes.

And that's it! You've just used Sweep to fix a problem on your website.
